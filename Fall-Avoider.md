# Fall-Avoider-Using-Arduino
Using arduino and a pair oof ir sensors we make a bot which won't fall off a table or any ledge.

First of all get all the required parts:

You can get all the material for the above using the following links:

1 x Chassis --> https://a.co/d/2pmxRiq

2 x Dc Motor --> https://a.co/d/hThEPPq

2 x IR Sensor --> https://a.co/d/a8pLr5r

1 x L298 Motor Driver --> https://a.co/d/6bdZdHH

1 x Arduino Uno --> https://a.co/d/2X68hMl

1 x 12v rechargable battery --> https://a.co/d/3i5x2lS

As per need x Jumper wires --> https://a.co/d/9OpCN2D

On the chassis for the bot put all components for working something like this:

Now for the coding part i will provide the code below for the functioning:

you can download the code using the given link and put it in your arduino:

Congratulations you have built your own obstacle avoider bot using arduino uno.

After attatching the battery mine was working completely fine as you can see in the video:
